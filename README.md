# Python Flask Project
  For this mini project, I used Python, SQL, and Flask to build out a basic API database. The SQL table allows a user to add, delete, edit, and view contact cards that display a person's name and phone number. This application can be used as a contact book.

# Installation
  To use this application, run the following commands in your terminal:
    pip3 install pipenv
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    python3 main.py

# Software
  -Python
  -Peewee
  -SQL
  -Flask

# Endpoints
| GET, PUT | '/person' | Retrieves all people stored in the database. |
| GET, PUT, DELETE | '/person/<id>' | Retrieves a specific person's information by their id. |
